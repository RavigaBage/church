Both **AWS** and **Google Cloud** offer robust solutions for hosting websites, including PHP with MySQL, GitHub integration, and automated deployment. Here's a breakdown of how you can use each service:

---

### **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**

#### **1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
   - **Elastic Beanstalk** makes it easy to deploy and manage applications built in multiple languages, including PHP.
   - It automatically handles resource provisioning (EC2, load balancing, scaling), and you can connect it to **RDS** (Relational Database Service) for MySQL.
   - Elastic Beanstalk also integrates with **GitHub**, allowing you to deploy directly from your GitHub repository.

   **Key Features:**
   - Automatic scaling, load balancing, and monitoring.
   - GitHub integration for deployments.
   - Supports PHP OOP and RequireJS with customizable environments.
   - Use **Amazon RDS** for managed MySQL database.

   **Setup:**
   - Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment for PHP.
   - Link your GitHub repository for continuous deployment.
   - Set up an RDS MySQL instance for your database.
   - Customize environment variables for database credentials in Elastic Beanstalk.

#### **2. AWS Lightsail**
   - **AWS Lightsail** is a simpler alternative to Elastic Beanstalk, offering VPS (Virtual Private Servers) with pre-configured options for PHP, MySQL, and LAMP stack.
   - It’s beginner-friendly and has **GitHub Actions** integration for automated deployments.
   - Ideal for smaller projects with lower complexity but still provides AWS-level scalability.

   **Key Features:**
   - Simpler than Elastic Beanstalk.
   - Pre-configured PHP and MySQL environments.
   - GitHub Actions support for automated deployment.
   - Built-in static IP and SSL management.

   **Setup:**
   - Create a Lightsail instance and select the LAMP stack.
   - Connect GitHub Actions to automate deployments.
   - Use the built-in MySQL setup or create a managed RDS MySQL database.
   - Upload your PHP code and connect it to the database.

### **Google Cloud**

#### **1. Google App Engine (GAE)**
   - **Google App Engine** is a fully managed platform that automatically scales based on traffic. It supports PHP OOP, MySQL, and integrates with GitHub for deployment.
   - GAE works with **Cloud SQL**, which is a fully managed MySQL database service.
   - It supports automatic deployment from GitHub, CI/CD pipelines, and easy scaling for high traffic.

   **Key Features:**
   - Fully managed environment, scales automatically.
   - GitHub integration for deployment.
   - Supports PHP, RequireJS, and other modern tech stacks.
   - Use **Google Cloud SQL** for MySQL database.

   **Setup:**
   - Set up a Google App Engine instance for PHP.
   - Link your GitHub repository for continuous deployment.
   - Create a Cloud SQL instance for your MySQL database.
   - Configure environment variables for database credentials and deploy your app.

#### **2. Google Cloud Compute Engine**
   - **Compute Engine** provides more control, allowing you to set up a virtual machine (VM) with a custom PHP/MySQL environment.
   - You can use **GitHub Actions** or Google Cloud’s CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments from GitHub.
   - This service offers flexibility but requires more manual setup compared to App Engine.

   **Key Features:**
   - Complete control over your environment.
   - Manual setup of PHP, MySQL, and RequireJS.
   - GitHub Actions or custom CI/CD pipeline for deployments.
   - Scalable and customizable resources.

   **Setup:**
   - Set up a Compute Engine VM with a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
   - Integrate with GitHub for continuous deployment.
   - Set up Cloud SQL for MySQL or host the database directly on your VM.
   - Use CI/CD tools to automate deployment processes.

### **Which One to Choose?**

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** and **Google App Engine** are good choices for ease of use and scalability. They both offer fully managed environments, automatic scaling, and integrate easily with GitHub for continuous deployment.
  
- **AWS Lightsail** is more user-friendly and less complex, ideal if you need to get started quickly with a simpler solution that still provides scalability when needed.

- **Google Compute Engine** and **AWS EC2** are great if you need more control over your environment but require more setup and manual configuration.

If you're looking for an enterprise-level solution or expect significant traffic, **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** or **Google App Engine** with a managed database (RDS or Cloud SQL) is recommended. For smaller projects, **AWS Lightsail** or **Google Cloud Compute Engine** offers more simplicity.

**Cost Consideration:** Both AWS and Google Cloud offer free tiers, so you can experiment without incurring large upfront costs.
